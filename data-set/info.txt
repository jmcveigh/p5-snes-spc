Update 5:
-Four additional song variants added.

Update 4:
-Numerous new variants (mostly of the "Hurry Up"
 variety), and a couple redumps and new jingles.
-Order changed dramatically, to work in all the
 additions from the last few updates.

Update 3:
-Several tracks redumped to remove sound effects.
-"Special World" song broken into two SPCs: one
 for the main song, and one for the hidden SMB remix.
-Track titles modified to better fit the game.
-Order changed slightly.

Update 2:
-"Unused Song" removed. Seems it's not located in
 the actual game's music data; it appears to be a
 corrupt version of the title theme from the
 Nintendo DS game, "New Super Mario Bros."

Update:
-Six new jingles and an unused song added.

Version: v1.1
